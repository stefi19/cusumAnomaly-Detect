TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.027 ns between COUNTER_inst/cnt_reg[4]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and CUSUM_inst/FIFO1_inst/inst/gen_fifo.xpm_fifo_axis_inst/xpm_fifo_base_inst/gen_sdpram.xpm_memory_base_inst/gen_wr_a.gen_word_narrow.mem_reg/DIADI[2] (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
